## 📌 Project Overview

**TrashNet** is a machine learning-powered solution designed to assist in automatic waste classification. Our goal is to encourage better recycling habits and reduce human error in waste sorting by leveraging AI.

Users simply upload a photo of waste, and TrashNet identifies the category — plastic, paper, metal, etc. This can be integrated into smart bins, mobile apps, or educational platforms.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Model Training**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras  
- **Data Handling**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas  
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Back-End**: Flask (depending on the stack used)  
- **Dataset**: Custom image dataset of labeled waste categories  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**: Waste images were collected, resized, and preprocessed.
2. **Model Training**: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained on the dataset to classify the waste.
3. **Prediction**: Once trained, the model predicts the class of any new input image with high accuracy.
4. **Deployment**: The model is integrated with a responsive web front-end, allowing users to interact with the system.

## 📊 Results

- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved over 90% accuracy on test data.
- **Evaluation**: Confusion matrix shows strong classification across all waste types.
- **Performance**: Real-time predictions in under 1 second.
